Project Name: Travel Management System
Our project is focused on creating a system for handling travel-related activities, such as booking packages for various counties in Ireland. The system's primary goal is to streamline and automate the travel management process, making it easier for people to manage their travel programs efficiently. Furthermore, the technology will assist firms in ensuring that their travel policies are followed, as well as offering analytics and statistics to help optimize their travel programs. Finally, the system will be integrated on a web server, allowing travellers to manage their travel arrangements and spending while on the go, boosting their overall travel experience.
