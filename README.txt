Project Name: Travel Management System
Our project is focused on creating a system for handling travel-related activities, such as booking packages for various counties in Ireland. The system's primary goal is to streamline and automate the travel management process, making it easier for people to manage their travel programs efficiently. Furthermore, the technology will assist firms in ensuring that their travel policies are followed, as well as offering analytics and statistics to help optimize their travel programs. Finally, the system will be integrated on a web server, allowing travellers to manage their travel arrangements and spending while on the go, boosting their overall travel experience.

The framework of a travel management project often contains numerous stages and components that try to ensure seamless and effective travel operations. This project includes the following components:
1.	Planning and organizing travel: This step entails defining the project's scope and objectives, establishing the organization's travel needs and preferences, and developing a travel management plan.
2.	Booking and reservations: This stage entails making travel plans, such as booking packages as well as ensuring that the Customer is registered and all his required documents, such as visas and passports, are secured.
3.	Travel policy compliance: This stage entails ensuring that all travel is in accordance with corporate policies and regulations, and that all relevant clearances are received prior to booking travel.
Overall, the framework of a travel management project is intended to streamline travel operations, decrease costs, and provide our customers and other stakeholders with a safe and efficient travel experience.
The project's flowchart begins with a registration page for users who have not yet registered, while those who have already registered can directly log in. Administrators will also have access to a login page.
After logging into their account, the consumer can select a package that meets their needs. They will be sent to a booking page after picking a package.
After completing the booking form, the admin will evaluate and verify the customer's information. Following confirmation, the admin will reserve a slot for the customer.
The server-side backend handles data management and business logic in this project. Backend systems are often created in Python and JavaScript, with MySQL serving as a database management system to store and handle data.
The client-side frontend, on the other hand, is in charge of the user interface and user experience. Frontend development technologies like as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are widely used. HTML provides structure to the content of a webpage, CSS handles layout and design, and JavaScript adds interaction and dynamic capability.
